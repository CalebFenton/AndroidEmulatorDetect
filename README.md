# Android Emulator Detect

This project contains an Android app which has many different anti-emulator / anti-vm methods.

It's main purpose is to test the anti-vm rules for [APKiD](https://github.com/rednaga/APKiD). It doesn't contain anything new.

Many of the ideas are borrowed from the resources listed in the references.
